        <h1>The way content creation was meant to be.</h1>
        <p>We're redefining the creator economy with
           a fair and decentralized platform that puts people 
           first. Creators keep real ownership of their work and 
           earn what they deserve. Viewers are rewarded for their 
           engagement, creating a system where everyone wins.</p>

        <h2>Attention should be rewarded.</h2>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Creators earn more here because we believe their work
           deserves more. Our revenue model gives a larger share
            back to the people who make the content.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Our verified user system ensures real accounts and authentic
           engagement. Advertisers get a trusted space where their
            messages reach genuine audiences.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Viewers earn by watching ads and supporting creators. The
           more they engage, the higher they climb on the leaderboard,
            unlocking exclusive rewards.</p>

        <p>I've always loved pancakes, but my wallet didn't. Every
           Saturday morning felt like a sad, syrup-less tragedy. Then I
            discovered BeeRoll. BeeRoll finally lets me fund my pancake
             obsession. Breakfast is now a full-time job and I'm not mad
              about it. More views, more pancakes, more happiness.</p>
